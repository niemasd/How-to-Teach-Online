In this chapter,
we will be discussing different modalities of instruction that can incorporate online learning.
We will present each modality,
and we will discuss how online learning can be effectively utilized in each.
This chapter will establish more generalized frameworks of teaching,
and future chapters will hone in on specific tasks that can be implemented within those frameworks.

## Fully In-Person

While it might seem strange for a resource titled *How to Teach Online* to begin with a discussion about fully in-person instruction,
we wanted to start things off with what is typically the most "traditional" modality of instruction that readers might be most familiar with.
In a fully in-person class,
all core instruction occurs in physically within the classroom.
By definition, fully in-person instruction is synchronous:
the instructor and the students physically meet at a lecture hall or classroom,
and the core instruction occurs synchronously during this in-person meeting time.

### The Good

A primary benefit of fully in-person instruction is that it can make
direct interactions between the instructor and the students easier and more natural to facilitate.
For example, instructors have the ability to physically move around the classroom,
which enables instructors to employ engaging teaching techniques such as
{term}`Peer Instruction` {cite:p}`crouch_peer_2001,knight_peer_2018,porter_halving_2013`
and {term}`Small-Group Discussion` {cite:p}`cohen_restructuring_1994,pollock_learning_2011,bennett_talking_2010`.

### The Bad

A key downside of fully in-person instruction is its inflexibility:
it relies on an entire class of students to physically come to the classroom at a specified time.
A myriad of issues can prevent students from physically coming to class:
illness, family/work obligations, social/personal life issues, commute challenges, etc.
{cite:p}`gersten_barriers_2023,salguero_understanding_2021`.
Even factors as small as not wanting to wake up early can be a non-trivial barrier to coming to class
(and a student's definition of "early" might differ dramatically from an instructor's!).

Another key limitation of fully in-person instruction is that it does not scale well:
an instructor can easily interact with every student in a classroom of 20 students,
*maybe* even 50 students,
but when a classroom hits *hundreds* of students,
it becomes infeasible for the instructor to directly interact with every single student.
Employing innovative pedagogical techniques such as
{term}`Micro-Classes` {cite:p}`alvarado_micro-classes_2017`
can help improve the scalability of in-person instruction,
but these methods typically require significant staff resources at scale.

## Glossary

```{glossary}
Micro-Classes
  Pre-assigned small groups of students led by an Instructional Assistant that remain the same throughout the entire course {cite:p}`alvarado_micro-classes_2017`.
Peer Instruction
  A teaching method in which each student applies the core concepts, and then explains those concepts to their classmates {cite:p}`crouch_peer_2001`.
Small-Group Discussion
  In-class discussions among small groups of students (not necessarily pre-assigned), potentially facilitated by members of the instructional staff {cite:p}`cohen_restructuring_1994`.
