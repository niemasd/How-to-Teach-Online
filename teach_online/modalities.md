In this chapter,
we will be discussing different modalities of instruction that can incorporate online learning.
We will present each modality,
and we will discuss how online learning can be effectively utilized in each.
This chapter will establish more generalized frameworks of teaching,
and future chapters will hone in on specific tasks that can be implemented within those frameworks.

## Fully In-Person

While it might seem strange for a resource titled *How to Teach Online* to begin with a discussion about fully in-person instruction,
we wanted to start things off with what is typically the most "traditional" modality of instruction that readers might be most familiar with.
In a fully in-person class,
all core instruction occurs in physically within the classroom.
By definition, fully in-person instruction is synchronous:
the instructor and the students physically meet at a lecture hall or classroom,
and the core instruction occurs synchronously during this in-person meeting time.

### The Good

The primary benefit of fully in-person instruction is that it can make
direct interactions between the instructor and the students easier and more natural to facilitate.
For example, instructors have the ability to physically move around the classroom,
which enables instructors to employ engaging teaching techniques such as
**Peer Instruction** {cite:p}`crouch_peer_2001,knight_peer_2018,porter_halving_2013`
and **Small Group Discussion** {cite:p}`pollock_learning_2011,bennett_talking_2010`.
