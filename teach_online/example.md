# Niema's Example Course

```{note}
Source Code: [`teach_online/example.md`](https://github.com/niemasd/How-to-Teach-Online/blob/main/teach_online/example.md)
```

In this section,
I will provide a complete example of one of the courses I commonly teach:
UCSD's [CSE 100](https://catalog.ucsd.edu/courses/CSE.html#cse100) course (*Advanced Data Structures*).
Even if this exact recipe doesn't work for the courses you teach,
I hope that tidbits of the structure I use can give you some interesting ideas about how to structure your own courses.
