# Academic Integrity

```{note}
Source Code: [`teach_online/academic_integrity.md`](https://github.com/niemasd/How-to-Teach-Online/blob/main/teach_online/academic_integrity.md)
```

In this chapter,
we will be discussing ways to maintain Academic Integrity in online assessments.
Some content in this chapter may overlap with other chapters
(e.g. if we discuss Academic Integrity when we introduce specific online assessment tools),
but this chapter will be structured in a way that is hopefully agnostic to specific tooling.
