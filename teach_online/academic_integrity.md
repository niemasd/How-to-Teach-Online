In this chapter,
we will be discussing ways to maintain Academic Integrity in online assessments.
Some content in this chapter may overlap with other chapters
(e.g. if we discuss Academic Integrity when we introduce specific online assessment tools),
but this chapter will be structured in a way that is hopefully agnostic to specific tooling.

## Exams

One of the most frequent concerns I have heard regarding maintaining
Academic Integrity in online courses is with respect to online exams.
Instructors often rely on exams to serve as comprehensive evaluations of student mastery,
and ensuring the integrity of this form of evaluation is an important goal.

### Remote Proctoring

When administering online exams,
especially in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic,
many instructors relied on {term}`Remote Proctoring`,
in which students take an exam on a computer
while being supervised by a person and/or computer software
{cite:p}`eaton_remote_2024`.
