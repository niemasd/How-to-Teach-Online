In this chapter,
we will be discussing ways to maintain Academic Integrity in online assessments.
Some content in this chapter may overlap with other chapters
(e.g. if we discuss Academic Integrity when we introduce specific online assessment tools),
but this chapter will be structured in a way that is hopefully agnostic to specific tooling.
This chapter draws heavily from {cite:t}`eaton_second_2024`,
a resource I *strongly* recommend for anyone curious about Academic Integrity.

## Terms and Concepts

Before discussing *any* techniques for maintaining Academic Integrity,
we first need to present some foundational terms and concepts.

### Deterrence vs. Detection

There are two key terms that describe two closely-related yet distinct concepts:
**deterrence** and **detection**.
{term}`Deterrence` is the act of correctly identify cases of cheating
(e.g. by comparing submissions, witnessing copying, using plagiarism detection tools, etc.),
whereas {term}`deterrence` is the act of stopping/preventing people from cheating {cite:p}`eaton_remote_2024`
(e.g. by proctoring/monitoring students, convincing them they will get caught and receive a severe penalty, etc.).

## Exams

One of the most frequent concerns I have heard regarding maintaining
Academic Integrity in online courses is with respect to online exams.
Instructors often rely on exams to serve as comprehensive evaluations of student mastery,
and ensuring the integrity of this form of evaluation is an important goal.

### Remote Proctoring

When administering remote exams,
especially in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic,
many instructors relied on {term}`remote proctoring`,
in which students take an exam on a computer
while being supervised by a person and/or computer software
{cite:p}`eaton_remote_2024`.
The idea behind remote proctoring is intuitive:
students are typically proctored when they take in-person exams,
so they should be proctored when they take remote exams... Right?
