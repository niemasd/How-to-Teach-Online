In this chapter,
we will be discussing ways to maintain Academic Integrity in online assessments.
Some content in this chapter may overlap with other chapters
(e.g. if we discuss Academic Integrity when we introduce specific online assessment tools),
but this chapter will be structured in a way that is hopefully agnostic to specific tooling.
This chapter draws heavily from {cite:t}`eaton_second_2024`,
a resource I *strongly* recommend for anyone curious about Academic Integrity.

## Terms and Concepts

Before discussing *any* techniques for maintaining Academic Integrity,
we first need to present some foundational terms and concepts.

### Deterrence vs. Detection

There are two key terms that describe two closely-related yet distinct concepts:
**deterrence** and **detection**.
{term}`Deterrence` is the act of correctly identify cases of cheating
(e.g. by comparing submissions, witnessing copying, using plagiarism detection tools, etc.),
whereas {term}`deterrence` is the act of stopping/preventing people from cheating {cite:p}`eaton_remote_2024`
(e.g. by proctoring/monitoring students, convincing them they will get caught and receive a severe penalty, etc.).

## Exams

One of the most frequent concerns I have heard regarding maintaining
Academic Integrity in online courses is with respect to online exams.
Instructors often rely on exams to serve as comprehensive evaluations of student mastery,
and ensuring the integrity of this form of evaluation is an important goal.

### Remote Proctoring

When administering remote exams,
especially in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic,
many instructors relied on {term}`remote proctoring`,
in which students take an exam on a computer
while being supervised by a person and/or computer software
{cite:p}`eaton_remote_2024`.
The idea behind remote proctoring is intuitive:
students are typically proctored when they take in-person exams,
so they should be proctored when they take remote exams... Right?

Well, the situation might not be so simple.
In a proctored in-person exam,
all students leave their homes to meet at a specified location to take their exam
(commonly a lecture hall or some other facility at their university).
In remote proctoring, however,
most students take the exam from their home
(typically in a personal space like their bedroom) {cite:p}`stone_understanding_2021`.
Taking an exam is already stressful enough,
but being watched over the internet contributes to test anxiety
(as well as exacerbating other equity issues, such as internet literacy,
access to reliable technology and a dedicated study space, etc.) {cite:p}`conijn_fear_2022`.
Is this infringement of student privacy a necessary evil {cite:p}`selwyn_necessary_2023` to ensure Academic Integrity?

{cite:t}`eaton_remote_2024` provides an excellent exploration of the evidence for and against the use of remote proctoring,
so I *highly* recommend reading it thoroughly.
Here, I will briefly summarize the key points of discussion:

* With respect to **deterrence** of cheating:
  * Many studies split students into "proctored" vs. "unproctored" groups and evaluate student grades across groups
  * Many of these studies find lower grades in the "proctored" group
    * This result is commonly interpreted as evidence of deterrence of cheating
      {cite:p}`akaaboune_accountability_2022,alessio_examining_2017,
               carstairs_internet_2009,rupert_remote_2016,dendir_cheating_2020,
               harmon_are_2008,karim_cheating_2014,reisenwitz_examining_2020,stapleton_remote_2021`
    * Additional test anxiety could also be a contributing factor to lower performance
* With respect to **detection** of cheating:
  * Remote proctoring services claim to be effective at catching cheating
  * In reality, they don't seem to be very effective
    * At least not if students have some reasonable technical know-how {cite:p}`burgess_watching_2022,bergmans_efficacy_2021`
* With respect to **privacy**:
  * Some students feel uncomfortable, but others are actually fine with being proctored remotely {cite:p}`karim_cheating_2014,selwyn_necessary_2023`
  * There are also privacy concerns regarding how proctoring companies store/use student data {cite:p}`langenfeld_internetbased_2020`
  * It can contribute to the culture of surveillance and to the acceptance of surveillance in other realms {cite:p}`dawson_defending_2020`

Again, I *strongly* encourage you to read {cite:t}`eaton_remote_2024` in its entirety,
as it does an *excellent* job presenting the research regarding the pros and cons of remote proctoring.
If, after reading the relevant research and weighing the pros and cons,
you decide that you want to conduct remote proctoring in your course,
the following services may be of interest:

* [ProctorU](https://www.proctoru.com/) (now [Meazure Learning](https://www.meazurelearning.com/exam-proctoring/remote-exam-proctoring)) has live proctors monitor students in real-time
* [Proctorio](https://proctorio.com/) records students while they take exams and performs automated software-based video analysis as well as live human review
* Depending on the size of your class, your course staff can proctor students live using [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) or similar video conferencing services
