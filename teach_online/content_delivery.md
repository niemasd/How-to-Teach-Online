Once you have *developed* course materials and assessments,
you of course need some way to *deliver* them to students.
In this section,
we will discuss some different platforms for instructional content delivery.
This section of *How to Teach Online* is the most prone to going out-of-date,
so contributions are *especially* welcome here.

## Learning Management System (LMS)

A {term}`Learning Management System (LMS)` is a
software application for the administration, documentation, tracking, reporting,
automation,and delivery of educational courses/materials {cite:p}`tatnall_learning_2020`.
Many universities use a single LMS platform across the entire institution,
so you may not have much freedom to choose between LMS options.
Regardless, in this subsection,
we will provide an overview of common LMS choices.

## Course Website

Many instructors simply use their {term}`Learning Management System (LMS)` as their course website,
as most LMS choices have some functionality to define custom web pages,
but some instructors who may feel limited by the web page functionalities of their LMS may want to
host an external course website as well.
If you choose to do this,
I strongly encourage you to point to it directly from the landing page of your course LMS
(otherwise students may become confused).
In this subsection,
we will provide an overview of common choices for hosting course websites outside of a course LMS.

## Discussion Board

Many courses utilize an online discussion board system to enable asynchronous communication between students and course staff.
The {term}`Learning Management System (LMS)` that you are using may already include discussion board functionality,
but in this subsection,
we will provide an overview of common choices for dedicated discussion board platforms.

## Instructional Text

It has become increasingly user-friendly to author fairly robust text-based content on the internet,
and as a result,
rather than relying entirely on a textbook,
many instructors have become empowered to write their own instructional materials
(in part, or potentially even in full!).
We provided an overview and discussion of different options for authoring one's own instructional text resources
in the [Instructional Materials](instructional-materials-online-text) section of this online resource,
so rather than repeating ourselves
(and inevitably becoming outdated in two separate pages),
we will just point you to that page for this specific topic.
