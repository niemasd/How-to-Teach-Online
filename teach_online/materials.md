As one can imagine,
simply taking long recordings of in-person lectures and throwing them online is *very* poor pedagogy:
when students physically come to a classroom for an in-person lecture,
they have already consciously chosen to dedicate an hour within their daily schedule
to be able to focus on the lecture with their (hopefully) undivided attention.
With online learning, however,
students may not have hour-long block of uninterrupted time to watch a lecture,
and even if they do,
they will be more prone to distractions while they passively watch a lecture.

In this chapter,
we will be discussing different types of instructional materials one can incorporate into an online course,
and we will provide suggestions regarding how to design and implement these materials.
We want to emphasize that much of this advice can be used across multiple modalities of instruction
(e.g. both in-person and online classrooms can use online videos or text resources).

## Videos

Many online courses utilize videos to deliver course content.
Broadly speaking,
there are three extreme "types" of instructional videos one can create:

1. Recording of a person presenting a topic
   *([example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqcWr1qqjFA&list=PLQ-85lQlPqFNmbPEsMoxb5dM5qtRaVShn&index=5) by Pavel Pevzner)*
2. Recording of instructional materials (e.g. hand-written or slides) with voice-over
   *([example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39PVhxUp8P8&list=PLM_KIlU0WoXmkV4QB1Dg8PtJaHTdWHwRS&index=48) by me)*
3. Animations visualizing a topic (e.g. computer-generated) with voice-over
   *([example](https://youtu.be/VzPD009qTN4?si=EPoB07fnoC1szFjX) by Kurzgesagt)*

Of course, this is an extreme oversimplification,
and in practice,
a single video can incorporate a blend of all of these methods
(and potentially others not described here!),
but hopefully this gives you a decent idea of what is in the realm of possibility.

If you have given any lectures later than e.g. 2010,
*especially* if you have given any lectures during the COVID-19 pandemic,
chances are that you may already have recordings of those lectures at your disposal.
While it might be tempting to just throw those videos into an online course,
I highly encourage you not to do so.
