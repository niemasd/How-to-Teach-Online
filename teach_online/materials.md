As one can imagine,
simply taking long recordings of in-person lectures and throwing them online is *very* poor pedagogy:
when students physically come to a classroom for an in-person lecture,
they have already consciously chosen to dedicate an hour within their daily schedule
to be able to focus on the lecture with their (hopefully) undivided attention.
With online learning, however,
students may not have hour-long block of uninterrupted time to watch a lecture,
and even if they do,
they will be more prone to distractions while they passively watch a lecture.

In this chapter,
we will be discussing different types of instructional materials one can incorporate into an online course,
and we will provide suggestions regarding how to design and implement these materials.
We want to emphasize that much of this advice can be used across multiple modalities of instruction
(e.g. both in-person and online classrooms can use online videos or text resources).

## Videos

Many online courses utilize videos to deliver course content.
Broadly speaking,
there are three extreme "types" of instructional videos one can create:

1. Recording of a person presenting a topic
    * This is also known as the "talking head" video style
    * Example: [*Dynamic Programming and Backtracking Pointers*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqcWr1qqjFA&list=PLQ-85lQlPqFNmbPEsMoxb5dM5qtRaVShn&index=5) (Pavel Pevzner)
2. Recording of instructional materials (e.g. hand-written or slides) with voice-over
    * The hand-written tablet capture style is also known as "Khan-style" (named after [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/))
    * Example: [*Multiway Tries (MWTs)*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39PVhxUp8P8&list=PLM_KIlU0WoXmkV4QB1Dg8PtJaHTdWHwRS&index=48) (Niema Moshiri)
    * Tutorials: [*Making a KSV*](https://youtu.be/Ohu-5sVux28?si=RU-p4XGUYXkg8TDG) (Khan Academy),
                 [*Recording Khan Academy Style Videos*](https://github.com/niemasd/teaching/blob/master/Tutorials/VideosKhanAcademy.md) (Niema Moshiri)
3. Animations visualizing a topic (e.g. computer-generated) with voice-over
    * Example: [*How Bacteria Rule Over Your Body â€“ The Microbiome*](https://youtu.be/VzPD009qTN4?si=EPoB07fnoC1szFjX) (Kurzgesagt)

Of course, this is an extreme oversimplification,
and in practice,
a single video can incorporate a blend of all of these methods
(and potentially others not described here!),
but hopefully this gives you a decent idea of what is in the realm of possibility.
Videos (especially with the instructor's face)
can help make an otherwise fully isolated course *feel* more personal,
and the ability to incorporate motion and continuous visual flow
can make videos an engaging way to learn a topic {cite:p}`guo_how_2014`.
However, videos can be very difficult to standardize,
and they can be expensive and technically difficult to produce {cite:p}`hansch_video_2015`.
Further, once created,
a video is *incredibly* difficult and costly to update {cite:p}`compeau_life_2015`,
often requiring re-recording it
(in-part or in-full).

When creating instructional videos,
note that they have fairly rapid engagement drop-off,
and each individual video should ideally be **under 10 minutes**
{cite:p}`guo_how_2014,manasrah_short_2021`.
Further, it may be beneficial to try to make each individual video as modular as possible
(i.e., reduce dependencies on prior videos as much as possible)
to enable easy addition, removal, rearrangement, and replacement.

If you have given any lectures later than e.g. 2010,
*especially* if you have given any lectures during the COVID-19 pandemic,
chances are that you may already have recordings of those lectures at your disposal.
While they're likely *far* too long to use as-is,
all hope is not lost:
recordings of a longer traditional lecture can be split into smaller chunks,
potentially with added annotations and enhancements,
to be used as shorter instructional videos in online learning.
