	abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, CS courses at many institutions faced a sudden shift to fully-online instruction. Despite this shift in modality, many courses continued to administer single-student exams to assess student learning, yet these online exams typically lacked the ability to proctor students to enforce rules against collaboration. We describe a scalable approach for detecting exam similarity in online exams. The approach involves an Exam Similarity Score we define, and it includes empirical and theoretical approaches for gauging significance in the distribution of pairwise similarity scores across the class. We then present our experiences from utilizing the approach in an Advanced Data Structures course across two quarters, with more than 400 students in each offering of the course. We show that the approach was able to successfully detect cases of exam collaboration without significant investigative effort from the course instructional staff. An open source Python implementation of the approach can be found on GitHub: https://github.com/niemasd/MESS},

We also discuss ways we have improved our implementation of PI since introducing it in 1991. Most notably, we have replaced in-class reading quizzes with pre-class written responses to the reading, introduced a research-based mechanics textbook for portions of the course, and incorporated cooperative learning into the discussion sections as well as the lectures. These improvements are intended to help students learn more from pre-class reading and to increase student engagement in the discussion sections, and are accompanied by further increases in student understanding.},

	abstract = {Peer instruction, a form of active learning, is generally defined as an opportunity for peers to discuss ideas or to share answers to questions in an in-class environment, where they also have opportunities for further interactions with their instructor. When implementing peer instruction, instructors have many choices to make about group design, assignment format, and grading, among others. Ideally, these choices can be informed by research about the impact of these components of peer instruction on student learning. This essay describes an online, evidence-based teaching guide published by CBE—Life Sciences Education at http://lse.ascb.org/evidence-based-teaching-guides/peer-instruction . The guide provides condensed summaries of key research findings organized by teaching choices, summaries of and links to research articles and other resources, and actionable advice in the form of a checklist for instructors. In addition to describing key features of the guide, this essay also identifies areas in which further empirical studies are warranted.},

	abstract = {Moving beyond the general question of effectiveness of small group learning, this conceptual review proposes conditions under which the use of small groups in classrooms can be productive. Included in the review is recent research that manipulates various features of cooperative learning as well as studies of the relationship of interaction in small groups to outcomes. The analysis develops propositions concerning the kinds of discourse that are productive of different types of learning as well as propositions concerning how desirable kinds of interaction may be fostered. Whereas limited exchange of information and explanation are adequate for routine learning in collaborative seatwork, more open exchange and elaborated discussion are necessary for conceptual learning with group tasks and ill-structured problems. Moreover, task instructions, student preparation, and the nature of the teacher role that are eminently suitable for supporting interaction in more routine learning tasks may result in unduly constraining the discussion in less structured tasks where the objective is conceptual learning. The research reviewed also suggests that it is necessary to treat problems of status within small groups engaged in group tasks with ill-structured problems. With a focus on task and interaction, the analysis attempts to move away from the debates about intrinsic and extrinsic rewards and goal and resource interdependence that have characterized research in cooperative learning.},

The volume describes the fundamental principles of HyFlex design, explains a process for design and development, and discusses implementation factors that instructors have experienced in various higher education institutions. These factors include the drivers, the variations in implementation approaches and constraints, and the results (e.g., student scores, student satisfaction). A series of worksheets provides specific guidance that can be used by individuals or teams engaging in HyFlex design projects at their own institution. Case reports from institutions and faculty who have successfully implemented HyFlex-style courses provide a rich set of real-world stories to draw insights for a reader’s own design setting.},

	abstract = {The book brings together diverse views from around the world and provides a comprehensive overview of academic integrity and how to create the ethical academy. At the same time, the Handbook does not shy away from some of the vigorous debates in the field such as the causes of academic integrity breaches. There has been an explosion of interest in academic integrity in the last 20-30 years. New technologies that have made it easier than ever for students to 'cut and paste', coupled with global media scandals of high profile researchers behaving badly, have resulted in the perception that plagiarism is 'on the rise'. This, in combination with the massification and commercialisation of higher education, has resulted in a burgeoning interest in the importance of academic integrity, how to safeguard it and how to address breaches appropriately. What may have seemed like a relatively easy topic to address -- students copying sources without attribution -- has in fact, turned out to be a complex, interdisciplinary field of research requiring contributions from linguists, psychologists, social scientists, anthropologists, teaching and learning specialists, mathematicians, accountants, medical doctors, lawyers and philosophers, to name just a few. Because of this broad interest and input, this handbook serves as the single authoritative reference work which brings together the vast, growing, interdisciplinary and at times contradictory body of literature. For both established researchers/practitioners and those new to the field, this Handbook provides a one-stop-shop as well as a launching pad for new explorations and discussions},

Learning environments generally included houses and rarely included on-campus housing. The specific room type was predominantly the bedroom. Only conscientiousness was related positively to anticipated semester GPA. The positive relationship between anticipated and overall GPA supports the notion that more conscientious students tend to be successful in online learning situations, as online education was rated as slightly ineffective. A majority of students did not see a need for online proctoring due to the inability or time required to search for materials, which would only harm one’s performance. There is a need to research further the impact of the study environment, relationship of the students’ personality to learning success, and consequences of online proctoring during remote learning.},

Through analysis of interviews, documents, news, social media and marketing materials, the article examines the ‘appropriation’, ‘objectification’, incorporation’ and ‘conversion’ of proctoring technology from the perspective of commercial providers, university authorities, university staff and student groups.

              Background
              Online and blended learning need an appropriate assessment strategy which ensures academic integrity. During the pandemic, many universities have chosen for online proctoring. Although some earlier examples suggest that online proctoring may reduce cheating, the potential side‐effects of proctoring are largely unknown.
            
            
              Objectives
              Therefore, this study aims to identify the effects of proctoring on students' self‐reported temptation to cheat and potentially undesirable side‐effects, including test anxiety, perceived exam difficulty, and performance. In addition, we examine which contextual and student characteristics affect test anxiety during online exams.
            
            
              Methods
              For this, we collected four waves of survey data throughout a year of teaching during the pandemic at one faculty of a Dutch university, resulting in a total sample of 1760 students within 105 courses.
            
            
              Results and Conclusions
              Multi‐level analyses showed that while proctoring had no effect on the temptation to cheat, exam difficulty or performance, students reported higher levels of test anxiety. Some learning strategies, internet literacy, access to a reliable technology and a dedicated study space as well as gender and financial stress affect their test anxiety. To conclude, the decision to use online proctoring needs to consider the undesirable side‐effect on test anxiety. We discuss practical implications for university administrators, educational designers and teachers to reduce test anxiety.

              What is already known about this topic
              
                
                  
                    Proctoring is often used to ensure academic integrity in online exams.
                  
                  
                    Some evidence shows that proctoring reduces cheating.
                  
                  
                    Little is known about the potential negative side‐effects of proctoring.
                  
                
              
            
            
              What this paper adds
              
                
                  
                    The use of proctoring has no effect on the temptation to cheat.
                  
                  
                    The use of proctoring results in increased test anxiety.
                  
                  
                    Several student characteristics and contextual factors reduce text anxiety.
                  
                
              
            
            
              Implications for practice
              
                
                  
                    Consider potential negative side‐effects when choosing for proctoring.
                  
                  
                    Time management and internet literacy training might reduce test anxiety.
                  
                  
                    Simulating the exam environment might be used to reduce test anxiety.},

	abstract = {In this paper we report on the outcome of a controlled experiment using one of the widely available and used online proctoring systems, Proctorio. The system uses an AI-based algorithm to automatically flag suspicious behaviour, which can then be checked by a human agent. The experiment involved 30 students, 6 of which were asked to cheat in various ways, while 5 others were asked to behave nervously but make the test honestly. This took place in the context of a Computer Science programme, so the technical competence of the students in using and abusing the system can be considered far above average. The most important findings were that none of the cheating students were flagged by Proctorio, whereas only one (out of 6) was caught out by an independent check by a human agent. The sensitivity of Proctorio, based on this experience, should therefore be put at very close to zero. On the positive side, the students found (on the whole) the system easy to set up and work with, and belie ved (in the majority) that the use of online proctoring per se would act as a deterrent to cheating. The use of online proctoring is therefore best compared to taking a placebo: it has some positive influence, not because it works but because people believe that it works, or that it might work. In practice however, before adopting this solution, policy makers would do well to balance the cost of deploying it (which can be considerable) against the marginal benefits of this placebo effect.},

            Distance education allows educators, with the use of technology, to deliver curriculum to students who are separated from their instructors. As higher education evolves, enrollment in distance education continues to present challenges of academic dishonesty. Proctoring services can provide educators with a practical and cost effective approach to reduce academic dishonesty in accounting programs. This study examines the effects of online proctoring programs on students' exam performance in an online accounting course. Our findings show lower exam performance when proctoring services are used, consistent with a reduction in academic dishonesty. More importantly, we show that proctoring affects lower performing students' exam performance more than higher performing students. These results have implications for accounting faculty in designing accounting courses, which can be delivered through a distance learning approach while maintaining the academic integrity and rigor demanded by the accounting profession.},
